    <h2 style="font-size: 60px">HOW TO MAKE SPAGHETTI AGLIO OLIO:</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      To make classic spaghetti aglio olio, simply...
    </p>
    <ol style="font-size: 30px">
      <li>
        Cook the spaghetti. Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of
        boiling water until it is just one minute shy of being al dente.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Sauté the garlic. Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to
        the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium
        heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for
        3 to 5 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Toss the pasta in the sauce. Once the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to
        transfer the pasta immediately to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of
        the hot starchy pasta water. Toss the pasta continuously until it is
        evenly coated in the garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add
        in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Taste and season. Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of
        salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Serve. Serve immediately while it's nice and hot, garnished with any
        toppings that sound good.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">A few important tips:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 30px">
      <li>
        Have all your ingredients ready to go. Things move fairly quickly once
        the pasta begins to cook, so I recommend having all of your ingredients
        laid out, chopped and ready to go.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        It's important that the garlic not burn. If turns lightly golden before
        the pasta is ready to go, just remove the pan from the heat until it's
        time to add the pasta.
