My Project's Name: Muhammad Haziq Bin Razak FED ASSG 1
This website is catered to arctic monkeys fans to find out more about their favourite band and to buy merch and check out their videos and check live dates. 


Design Process
This will be the start of my documentation for the Assignment to create a responsive front end website.

The IDEA:
- Band ( Artic Monkeys)
- Games (Valorant, Overwatch, Minecraft)
- Playstation
- Photography

The idea:
I choose to make a website about arctic monkeys.
From the website, it looks aesthetically pleasing however, I feel that it can be improved with other added features.
Some of the features include some pictures of them during their live concerts and some videos that arctic monkeys fans might be interested in and the history of Arctic Monkeys.

This website should be able to help new fans to learn more about arctic monkey's past and be able to catch up in no time while also checking for merch and live dates and videos related to the band and to understand the band better. 
(Note that this is not a revamp of the original website rather a new website to help people learn more about arctic monkeys the band)
